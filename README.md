When I stumbled across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMnDmDOXH04) that explained how to do square root by hand, I wanted to implement that method in AutoHotkey.
So here it is, at least the first few decimal places are correct, I guess it's something with divisions.

I got the included library [Vec2](./Vec2.ahk) from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=8929), posted by user [Hellbent](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=82043&sid=d196dfa89761a2a1987a3ea96b31af7), therefore **HB**_Vector (I guess).
